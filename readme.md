This is a simple DropBox Clone. You can access the admin panel @ localhost:8000/admin after you spin up the server. You can add file and folders in the admin panel. You assign their place in the tree when creating them or afterwards by dragging and dropping them into their desired place. 

The file tree can be viewed @ localhost:8000/

All dependecies are inside pyproject.toml
